Students describe numerical information in written form and reach conclusions based on analysis at similar frequencies.\n“Reasonableness” and “Methodology” both score 3.20. Students decide when solutions are reasonable in context and describe methods used to solve quantitative problems at moderate frequencies. “Coherence/Purpose,” which involves constructing coherent arguments using multiple quantitative conclusions, has a mean score of 3.03.

Students with strong evaluation skills typically have strong interpretation abilities, and those who interpret numerical information also create visual representations of data.\nThe correlation between “How much has this course improved your general quantitative/numerical skills?” and “How much has this course improved your ability to apply QR to real-world problems?” (r = 0.90, p&lt;0.001). Notably, “Confidence in using numbers” shows no significant correlations with any variables, which may suggest that confidence operates somewhat independently from the reported quantitative reasoning skills, improvement, and engagement.\nThe “Using quantitative reasoning to examine real-world problems” shows moderate correlations with core quantitative reasoning skills, particularly with Methodology (r = 0.55, p&lt;0.001) and Reasonableness (r = 0.51, p&lt;0.001). This suggests relationships between classroom-based skills and their application to real-world issues.\nWithin the qualitative reasoning engagement variables, the analysis reveals a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.68, p&lt;0.001) between students’ reported frequency of encountering graphs and tables in everyday life and their experience with course-related situations in daily contexts.\nThe weakest correlations involve “Used quantitative reasoning to examine a real-world problem or issue,” which shows moderate correlations with “How frequently do you do calculations in your everyday life?” (r = 0.24, p&lt;0.001), “How frequently do you encounter graphs and tables in your everyday life?” (r= 0.26, p&lt;0.001), and “How frequently in your daily life do you encounter situations like those you have learned about in this course?” (r = 0.34, p&lt;0.001)."

Note that all variables were mean-centered prior to analyses to minimize multicollinearity.\nThe results reveal that four skills significantly influence the ability to construct coherent quantitative arguments. Specifically, the skill of describing the methods used to solve a quantitative problem and justifying their appropriateness increases the “Coherence/Purpose” score by 0.21 points on a 1-to-4 scale. Similarly, the ability to reach conclusions based on one’s own analysis of numerical information, such as numbers, graphs, or statistics, increases the score by 0.24 points. The most substantial impact arises from deciding when a solution or inference is reasonable within a problem’s context, which increases the Coherence/Purpose score by 0.53 points. Finally, “Carried out calculations, either by hand or using software” shows a negative effect, decreasing the Coherence/Purpose score by 0.11 points. This effect is significant at a marginal level (p &lt; 0.10), a less reliable but noteworthy influence that warrants further exploration. The model explains approximately 51.1% of the variance in “Coherence/Purpose” (R² = 0.511)."
