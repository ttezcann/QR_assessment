This site provides guidance on a survey tool to indirectly assess Quantitative Reasoning.

There are four steps:

1.  [Collect data](step_1.qmd)

2.  [Create an RStudio Cloud account](step_2.qmd)

3.  [Download/upload data and other files to RStudio](step_3.qmd)

4.  [Organize the content and render](step_4.qmd)

After completing these steps, RStudio (Quarto) will generate the report in both [HTML](standard.qmd) and [Word](word_format_long) formats.
