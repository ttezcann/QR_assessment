# Short form (7 questions)

This survey directly aligns with [CSUMB's seven QR areas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eij-N3jRgmW2dth-U7Mz3qb-zrdcTRJk/view) and enables:

1.  Reporting of both direct assessment scores (student proficiency) and indirect survey results (frequency of skill practice);

2.  Comprehensive insight into students' QR experiences.
